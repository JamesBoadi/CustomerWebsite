      <h2>Game</h2>

        <h3>1. Game in action</h3>

        <p><strong>Code location:</strong> the file named <strong>game.js</strong> located inside javascript folder.</p>

        <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSyP6Zc4u6w?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3>2. Advanced javascript</h3>

          <h4>Objects</h4>
          <p>Objects in this case are used for every piece of game that has to provide information or interact with other elements.
          The reason they are used is to define how certain objects behave in a simple and easily understandable way, for example
          projectile or tank objects within the game contain all of their behaviour in one prototype function
          (projectile has gravity and directional movement properties, tank object has specific gun movement, etc.) which makes everything
          easier to understand, update and maintain. <strong>Code location: game.js file, lines: 138-300.</strong>
          </p>

          <h4>Canvas</h4>
          <p>Canvas element and manipulation of it in javascript is the base of this game. Animation, physics and graphics were visualised and implemented
          using drawing functionality canvas element provides. For example object movement is created by drawing and redrawing each frame differently according to
          how it interacts with the suroundings.</p>

        <h3>3. Advanced game features</h3>

          <p>Collision detection and increasing difficulty (target size decreases every 5th successful hit). <strong>Code location: game.js file, lines: 58-62 and 316-342.</strong></p>
