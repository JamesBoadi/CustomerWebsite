      opacity property set to them in order to make them transparent.</p>

      <h3>Positioning</h3>

      and justify-content: space-between properties to align and separate logo and links. Width property and Margins are used on

      the same. Class .active is used to highlight elements in navigation bar which are currently visible to the user, styles.css lines: 58-61.
      Another use of class is with login and signup forms. Both areas are styled the same therefore class .inputfield is used on both, styles.css lines: 180-214.</p>

      because it needs individual styling and is only used once. IDs are assigned to each input field inside login and signup areas, they
      need to have IDs in order to access their values later on in the second part of the project, loginregister.php lines: 24, 26, 33, 35, 37.</p>
